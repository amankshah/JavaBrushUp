Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming where
objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass.
In Java, polymorphism allows you to write code that can handle objects of different types uniformly.

To demonstrate polymorphism in Java, let's consider an example.
Let's say we have a superclass called Animal and two subclasses called Dog and Cat.
